AP Physics Atwood Simluator
========================

For my AP Physics final project, I decided to make a simluator dealing with Atwood machines - one of the  classic  
favorites of all AP Physics students. What is an Atwood machine, you ask? Basically, it's a pulley system with some   
masses attached by a string which is wrapped around a pulley. Common questions involve finding the tension in the  
string or finding the acceleration of the masses, and there are multiple variations of the problem. The simulator  
models an Atwood machine where you can change the masses, the mass of the pulley itself, or the string tension.
